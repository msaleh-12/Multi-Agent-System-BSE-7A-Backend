# Peer Collaboration Agent

*A focused micro-service for analyzing team discussions, extracting themes, and offering collaboration insights.*

This agent listens to the rhythm of group conversations — who speaks, who drifts, where the tone leans — and transforms that raw chatter into structured, actionable guidance. It runs independently as part of a multi-agent ecosystem but can also be used as a standalone FastAPI microservice.

## 📡 API Overview
